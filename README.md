## uOttaHack 7 Project Submission

ThreatWatch is our team's submission to DeepCode's challenge for uOttaHack 7. We used Next.js , Shadcn and Tailwind for the front-end, and Nest.js, Typescript and MySQL for the back-end.

This tool enables organizations to efficiently parse, store, enrich, and search vast amounts of breach data, facilitating quicker incident response and mitigating potential threats.

The application focuses on processing large text files containing sensitive breach data (e.g., usernames, passwords, URLs), parsing this data into a structured format, and enriching it with additional context for enhanced usability. By doing so, ThreatWatch helps affected organizations identify specific breached data, prioritize incident responses, and take corrective measures efficiently.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
